        The attribute sent to the client in an Access-Accept packet, which is useful for correlating Accounting-Request packets with authentication sessions. The format is:
        Type contains the value 25 (1 octet).
        Length contains a value of 20 or greater (1 octet).
        Checksum contains an Adler-32 checksum that is computed over the remainder of the Class attribute (4 octets).
        Vendor-ID contains the ID of the NAS vendor (4 octets). The high-order octet is 0 and the low-order 3 octets are the SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code of the vendor in network byte order, as defined in "Private Enterprise Numbers" at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131594.
        Version contains the value of 1 (2 octets).
        Server-Address contains the IP address of the RADIUS server that issued the Access-Challenge message. For multihomed servers, this is the address of the network interface that received the original Access-Request message (2 octets).
        Service-Reboot-Time specifies the time at which the first serial number was returned (8 octets).
        Unique-Serial-Number contains a unique number to distinguish an individual connection attempt (8 octets).
        String contains information that is used to classify accounting records for additional analysis (0 or more octets). In NPS, the Class attribute is copied into the String field.
        The Class attribute is used to match the accounting and authentication records if it is sent by the NAS in the Accounting-Request message. The combination of Serial-Number, Service-Reboot-Time, and Server-Address must be a unique identification for each authentication that the RADIUS server performs.
